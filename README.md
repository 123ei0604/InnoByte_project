# 🌴 King Sukh Guest House – Website Redesign  
**Internship Project | Innobyte Services Pvt. Ltd.**

## 👋 Introduction

Hey there! Welcome to the redesigned digital home of **King Sukh Guest House**, a serene escape nestled in the lap of nature. This project was part of my internship at **Innobyte Services**, where I was tasked with reimagining and rebuilding the existing website: [kingsukhguesthouse.com](https://www.kingsukhguesthouse.com/).

The mission?  
To craft a **visually engaging**, **responsive**, and **user-friendly** website that not only promotes the guest house’s services but also enhances the overall digital experience for visitors. And trust me, I had a blast bringing it to life! 🌟
